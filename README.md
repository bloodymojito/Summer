# **Summer**
*It is a sultry day; the sun has drank* 
The dew that lay upon the morning grass, 
*There is no rustling in the lofty elm* 
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade 
*Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint* 
And interrupted murmur of the bee, 
*Settling on the sick flowers, and then again* 
Instantly on the wing. The plants around 
*Feel the too potent fervors; the tall maize* 
Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops 
*Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.*
